> [!WARNING]
> **PLEASE NOTE:** We stopped further development on this client. You may still use it, but it will only receive bug fixes. Starting Q4/2024 we decided to focus all efforts on developing [ts-scan](https://github.com/trustsource/ts-scan), which also covers all capabilities of this solution.
